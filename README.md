## Our Journey
###### It all started november5th when my friend was doing her homework. It was called "invention convention" basicly you have to make up three invention ideas one of them was a virtual library. when she told me i had a brain wave and thought that we could make it into a bussiness idea ,having already done a lemonade stand we knew how to do bussiness.
