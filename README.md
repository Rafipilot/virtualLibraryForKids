## Our journey
###### It all started november5th 2020 when i  was doing my  homework. It was called "invention convention" basically i had to make up three invention ideas one of them was a virtual library. When i told my best friend about it we had brain wave and thought that we could make it into a business idea ,having already done a lemonade stand together we knew how to do business.Together till now, we continue to be great buisiness partners!-even as we are writing this. Have a good day.
